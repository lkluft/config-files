# Listing channel locations in the .condarc file will override conda defaults,
# causing conda to search only the channels listed here, in the order given.
#
# Use defaults to automatically include all default channels. Non-url channels
# will be interpreted as Anaconda.org usernames, and this can be changed by
# modifying the channel_alias key as explained below. The default is just
# defaults.
channels:
  - rttools
  - conda-forge
  - defaults

# Choose the yes option whenever asked to proceed, such as when installing.
# Same as using the --yes flag at the command line. The default is False.
always_yes: False

# When using activate, change the command prompt ($PS1) to include the
# activated environment. The default is True.
changeps1: False

# Show channel URLs when displaying what is going to be downloaded and
# in 'conda list'. The default is False.
