# Listing channel locations in the .condarc file will override conda defaults,
# causing conda to search only the channels listed here, in the order given.
#
# Use defaults to automatically include all default channels. Non-url channels
# will be interpreted as Anaconda.org usernames, and this can be changed by
# modifying the channel_alias key as explained below. The default is just
# defaults.

  - defaults

# When using activate, change the command prompt ($PS1) to include the
